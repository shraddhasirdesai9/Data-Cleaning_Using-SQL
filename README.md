# Data-Cleaning_Using-SQL
data cleaning in SQL of sample superstore data set

In this SQL project, I have done data cleaning using SQL queries.Here are some common steps involved in the data cleaning process in SQL:

1)Identify missing or null values 
2)Replace or remove missing values 
3)Identify duplicates 
4)Correct data types 
5)Remove irrelevant or inconsistent data
6)Standardize values 

Overall, data cleaning is an essential step in the data preparation process that ensures the accuracy and reliability of data used in data analysis.

The raw dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgup0402/uncleaned-sample-superstore

I used MySQL Workbench and imported the uncleaned csv file to a SQL Database in my local machine to carry forward with data cleaning process.
